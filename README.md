### Group project: Recommending restaurants for groups

In practice, we rarely eat out alone. Whether you dine out with friends, colleagues, partners, or
strangers, the decisions of which restaurant to choose are usually made by aggregating each
individuals' preferences and weights. As a result, a good recommendation system should
consider who you're together with and each individualâ€™s decision weights.
To solve this problem, we plan to generalize the OkCupid matching function to make a better
recommendation system. Our new matching function will calculate the scores (as a vector) on
the group's weighted preferences for different restaurant attributes. For each attribute dimension,
a higher score means more people agree on this and think it's important. Then we can
recommend the restaurants from Yelp data by ranking their distance from these scores. Also, we
plan to try the similarity function (KNN or collaborative filter) to cluster group preference and
make comparisons
